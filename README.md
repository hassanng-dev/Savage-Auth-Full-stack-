How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS, Express, and MongoDB

How I built this project is using HTML and CSS for markup text and styling. I used Javascript for the logic of the project.With Javascript I created the ability for users to interact with post created in the thread. There is a thumbs up and down button for users to either like or dislike the post. In the back-end I used MongoDB to store any data I submitted to my database. Express was used to simplify the process of creating my database to store information. I was passionate about this project because I recongized that there were many times when I would go grocery shopping with just a mental list. After awhile I would forget an item or two and would have to make a second trip back.

LESSON LEARNED:

The lesson I learned is the process of using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to save information to my database. I learned more about Javascript and how powerful it is in the client and server side. I am excited to create more projects!
